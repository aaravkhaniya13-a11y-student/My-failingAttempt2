  <h2>Introduction to Programming</h2>
  <p>
    Programming is the process of writing instructions that a computer can understand and execute.
    These instructions are written using programming languages such as Python, Java, HTML, and many others.
    Programming helps humans communicate with computers and allows machines to perform tasks like calculations,
    data processing, automation, and problem solving. Without programming, modern technology such as mobile apps,
    websites, games, and smart devices would not exist.
